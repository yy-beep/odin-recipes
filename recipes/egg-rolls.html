    <em><h2 class="h2-headers orange">Description:</h2></em>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p class="description-1">Crispy egg rolls filled with seasoned pork, cabbage, and carrots are a fabulous side dish to serve alongside stir-fry dishes. These homemade egg rolls are almost identical to what you'd get at a Chinese restaurant! Serve warm with egg roll sauce or soy sauce if desired. It's easier than you think to make restaurant-worthy egg rolls in the comfort of your own kitchen. With this top-rated recipe, you'll learn how to make perfect egg rolls (and how to roll egg rolls) in less than half an hour.</p>
        <p class="description-2">Contrary to popular belief, egg rolls don't contain any eggs. So where does the name come from? Nobody quite knows, but there are a couple of theories. One legend holds that the popular appetizer is a twist on a dish called Dan Gun, which consists of ingredients (such as ham, sprouts, and mushrooms) wrapped in a thin omelet. Since omelets are made of eggs, the newer dish was called an "egg roll."</p>
