This flavorful macaroni salad is easy to make and is perfect crowd-pleasing dish to bring to your next picnic or potluck.</p>
            <p class="description-paragraphs">Macaroni salad makes a great make-ahead potluck dish. In fact, since the flavors need time to meld in the refrigerator, it might actually be better to make it a day or two in advance. This homemade macaroni salad can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days, although we don't recommend it. </p>
