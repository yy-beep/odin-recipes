    <em><h2 class="h2-headers">Description</h2></em>
    
    <p class="description-paragraphs">This homemade chocolate cake recipe is super easy to prepare in one bowl for a deliciously moist and fluffy chocolate cake. This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had! Frost with your favorite frosting. Skip the store-bought mix and make this one-bowl chocolate cake from scratch. The Allrecipes community agrees: You don't want to miss this simple chocolate cake recipe.</p>
    <p class="description-paragraphs">You can absolutely freeze this chocolate cake. We recommend freezing the individual, unfrosted layers. Just wrap the (completely cooled) layers tightly in storage wrap. Follow that with a layer of aluminum foil labeled with the date. For the best protection, store the double-wrapped cake layers in an airtight container. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight.</p>
